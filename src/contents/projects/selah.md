Selah is an e-commerce site I built during the HNG11 internship as part of a task-based progression system. Initially, the site integrated with a product management system, Timbu, to fetch and display product details via an API. However, due to the discontinuation of the service and deletion of student accounts, I transitioned the data source to a JSON file.

The project includes essential e-commerce features such as a shopping cart with functionalities to add, remove, and clear items, as well as a basic checkout process. The design was based on a Figma file created by a fellow intern, and the implementation adhered strictly to pixel-perfect standards and functional requirements to meet the criteria for promotion to the next stage of the internship.

This project deepened my understanding of React, especially in using Context API for state management. It also taught me how to overcome challenges such as API integration issues and CORS errors under tight deadlines.

## Tasks
- Fetch product data from an external API (later transitioned to a JSON file).
- Implement e-commerce functionalities: add to cart, remove from cart, clear cart, and checkout.
- Create a pixel-perfect frontend based on a Figma design.
- Manage application state using React's Context API.

## Challenges
- **Tight Deadlines:** Completing the project within the given timeframe was challenging due to frequent electricity issues.
- **API Integration:** Encountered and resolved CORS errors while trying to integrate Timbu's API.
- **Service Discontinuation:** Transitioned from an API to a JSON file when Timbu was discontinued.


## Solutions
-  Managed time effectively by prioritizing key functionalities during electricity downtimes.
- Researched and applied workarounds to handle CORS errors during API integration.
- Adapted to changing requirements by using a JSON file to display products when the API service was no longer available.

## Highlights
- Successfully built a functional e-commerce platform with key shopping cart features.
- Achieved a pixel-perfect implementation of the Figma design, meeting all criteria for promotion in HNG11.
- Improved my proficiency in React, particularly in state management with Context API.

## Conclusion
Selah was a valuable learning experience that not only enhanced my technical skills but also demonstrated my ability to adapt to challenges and meet deadlines under constraints. The project reinforced my understanding of React development and strengthened my ability to work with APIs and alternative data sources.
